                   <h4>Background</h4>
                                     <p>Today, he plays a crucial role in taking financial decisions, strategic investments and key clients of United Group, which has propelled the Company very high with his acumen, foresight and an extraordinarily futuristic attitude. </p>
                                     <p>At the outset, he chose to set his mind on niche products and services like access flooring, which would became popular in India. It was realized as the Company entered into many collaborations with prominent names such as Armstrong, Hunter Douglas and USG. from the U.S. </p>
                                     <p>Today, United Group is one of the largest sellers of various products and services, most notably raised access flooring. As he observes, about 90% of the business that comes in is from the IT and ITES sector.
</p>
<p>The year 2005 proved to be a major turning point for United Group as the Company streamlined its operations entirely and began offering several innovative products such as false ceiling, fireproof walls, passive fire protection, industrial construction and more. This has resulted into establishment of another business division i.e United New designs and Projects Pvt.Ltd in the year 2009..</p>
<p>For him, after-sales service and bonding with the customer is no less important than a good product. United Group has always followed the policy of no compromise on services, which has brought in an overwhelming number of repeat orders for it.
</p><p>He believes in a positive, professional and process- driven work culture. He desires a team that is self-motivated and has a long-term vision and goes all out to provide the best services befitting the products the Company offers.</p>
